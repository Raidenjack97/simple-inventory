# simple-inventory

It'a module written in c# that provides all the necessary classes for creating a game inventory. It was written with unity3d in mind but the backend is decoupled from unity and will work in any engine that can use c#. There's also frontend implementation and example in unity3d. I also used TDD for creating backend and all tests are included.
